> Things I wanted to do/add but didn't have enough time:

* There are a couple of parts that I might have broken down into smaller, reusable components, such as the photograph cards present on both the question and results page. If I had more time, I would have made these child components and passed the data down on props.

* Testing the components.

* User authentication. Some sort of token auth system that keeps track of who is logged in. Can use this to attach name to each vote rather than requesting the name manually.

* Ability to add new questions. I tried to design this in a way that this would be easy to implement in the future.

* Would have used SASS if it was a larger application/ if I had more time.

> If I had done this in React, I think it would have been a lot more impressive/well organised! As I mentioned, I had never used or read about Vue before this.
